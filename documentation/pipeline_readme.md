# Documentation
Open Building Insights is composed of two distinct functional blocks. The first consists of the Python scripts used to extract various [attributes](/documentation/list_attributes/README.md. The second is the [website](https://obi.sdg7energyplanning.org/about.html), which hosts processed information for India and Kenya that users can easily download. This documentation focuses on the data pipeline (see image below) used to enrich building footprints with these attributes.

## Suggested pipeline  
This section outlines the computational workflow used to obtain OBI datasets in India and Kenya. The scripts used are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Open-Building-Insights/repositories), where each repository contains the relevant notebooks executed. These include: 
* Data preprocessing 	 
* Building classification 
* Informal settlement detection 
* Socio-economics 
* Distance Metrics / Proximity Calculations  
* Heat exposure
Energy Estimates
* Solar Rooftop Potencial
* Data Postprocessing
