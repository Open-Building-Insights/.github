### 📖 About Us

**Open Building Insights (OBI)** is a suite of AI-based algorithms and models coupled with an online, open-access, interactive visualization platform that offers building-level information at a user's fingertips.

We consolidate building datasets available in the public domain with state-of-the-art machine learning modelling pipelines, geospatial analytics, and cloud computing. Our goal is to enrich publicly available information on buildings at a national level in targeted geographies.
